Hello. I am making a game, that is an Idle, Incremental game where you grow a group of people into cities and eventually dominate the universe.

Resources
*People
  name:People
  desc:This is the number of people that are in your group. Look after them!
*Wood
  name:Wood
  desc:This is the foundry to you group. Use it to build houses and get more people.
*Food
  name:Food
  desc:This is what your group will eat to survive. Make sure you have enough of this!
